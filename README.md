# ITM AIR Lab

Official blueprint and vision for ITM AIR Lab (Artificial Intelligence Research Lab) — an open-source, student-driven research laboratory focused on foundational research in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision Models (CVMs).

Badges
- Status: Student‑driven • Open source
- Roadmap: 0–12 months
- License: MIT

## Mission
- Open-source research and tools.
- Focus on fundamental AI development with emphasis on LLMs and CVMs.
- Promote transparency, reproducibility, and high-quality academic output.

## Core Philosophy
- All research and releases are open-source.
- Emphasis on reproducible experiments, clear documentation, and ethical research practices.
- Foster a mentorship pipeline for junior researchers.

## Goals (First 6 Months)
- Publish one research paper per month.
- Release open datasets created and curated by the Data Department.
- Focus on fine-tuning existing models and developing novel model architectures.
- Deliver models for:
  - College-level educational applications
  - Custom solutions for partner organizations

## Growth Timeline
- 0–3 months
  - Publish high-impact papers.
  - Run workshops and research seminars.
  - Establish recognition as a leading AI lab in the city.
- 3–6 months
  - Become the official AI hub of the city.
- 6–12 months
  - Scale toward state-level recognition.
  - Launch flagship LLM/CVM projects and secure compute resources.

## Organization
Three core departments:
- Research Department: paper writing, experimental design, model architecture.
- Data Department: dataset creation, cleaning, annotation, curation.
- Development Department: training, fine-tuning, deployment, evaluation.

Each department will have:
- Department lead (student)
- Contributors (students, interns)
- Faculty/industry mentors (as available)

## Governance
Initial 0–6 months: student-led operations supported by a temporary management committee (college HODs) for approvals and resource facilitation.

After 6 months: formal Control Committee including:
- Senior faculty (1–2)
- External AI researchers (if available)
- Industry advisors
- Permanent student research fellows
- Lab Director

Responsibilities: long-term strategy, funding and grants, partnerships, and ethical oversight.

(See GOVERNANCE.md for more details)

## Transparency & Outreach
- Maintain a daily-updated website that includes:
  - Research progress and publications
  - Datasets and model releases
  - Lab news and technical articles
- Host regular seminars, workshops, and hackathons.

## Logo
- Based on a modified Lemniscate of Gerono, symbolizing infinite learning, mathematical foundation, and balance.

## Repo Structure (suggested)
- /papers — accepted/preprints and reproducibility packs
- /datasets — curated datasets and metadata
- /models — checkpoints, evaluation scripts, model cards
- /notebooks — experiments, tutorials
- /infrastructure — training scripts, Dockerfiles, infra-as-code
- README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, GOVERNANCE.md, ROADMAP.md, LICENSE

## How to Contribute
- Read CONTRIBUTING.md for the process.
- Open issues for proposed projects or contributions.
- Follow the branch/PR naming and review workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Roadmap & Milestones
See ROADMAP.md for detailed milestones and measurable KPIs for 0–12 months.
